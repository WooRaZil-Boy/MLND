    "Before we action, the agent should ask to someone. This is [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning). Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique. Specifically, Q-learning can be used to find an optimal action-selection policy for any given (finite) Markov decision process (MDP). It works by learning an action-value function that ultimately gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter. A policy is a rule that the agent follows in selecting actions, given the state it is in. When such an action-value function is learned, the optimal policy can be constructed by simply selecting the action with the highest value in each state. One of the strengths of Q-learning is that it is able to compare the expected utility of the available actions without requiring a model of the environment. Additionally, Q-learning can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring any adaptations. It has been proven that for any finite MDP, Q-learning eventually finds an optimal policy, in the sense that the expected value of the total reward return over all successive steps, starting from the current state, is the maximum achievable. \n",

    "## 3. Optimized Q-table with Exploit and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Why isn't the first algorithm optimized? Let's see the algorithm again:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi^{*}{(s)} = {\\operatorname{argmax}}{Q(s, a)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is a state, $a$ is an action, and $\\pi$ is a policy, $^{*}$ is meaning of optimization. According to this equation, the agent should move to next state that has the greatest value. So, although other route has more efficient way, the agent always moves in the same way. This is the problem of our first algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve our algorithm, although other state has small value, sometimes the agent should move to there. Let's call this method as **Exploit VS Exploration**. A simple key of this strategy is that sometimes the agent should move randomly. Here is a example in real life. I'm a big fan of Burger King Whopper. And I like McDonald's Big Mac too. But, I don't like KFC and Popeyes. If I express this as a score, here is my preference of food chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "![junk_food_reward](images/junk_food_reward.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though I want Big Mac to eat sometimes, according to our first algorithm, I will always go to Burger King. Because Burger King has the greatest preference value. And, I can't find a new delicious hamburger in other food chains. So, I decided to change my strategy. I will go to Burger King in weekdays, because it is my best food chain **(Exploit)**. But I will go to other food chain in weekend to find a new delicious hamburger **(Exploration)**. There are two ways to improve our strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is called an **$\\epsilon$-greedy policy**. The main concept of this method is that set a small probability. Let's call this probability $\\epsilon$ (epsilon). The agent will choose random action with $\\epsilon$ probability. Contrary, it will choose an action from ${Q(s, a)}$ with $1 - \\epsilon$ probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "e = 0.1\n",
    "if rand < e:\n",
    "    a = random\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    a = argmax(Q(s, a))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I will go to Burger King with a 90% chance. And I will go to other food chains with 10% chance. Like this, the agent will follow ${Q(s, a)}$ with 90% chance. And the agent will find new way with a 10% chance. But, this strategy isn't efficient. Because, as learning progresses, the agent need to find a new way less and less. So, at first, the agent needs to do a lot of exploring. Later when it has learned more, the agent can favor choosing actions based on what it has learned. This is called exploitation. We'll set it up so the agent is more likely to explore early in training, then more likely to exploit later in training. The is called an **decaying $\\epsilon$-greedy policy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    e = 0.1 / (i+1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if random(1) < e:\n",
    "        a = random\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        a = argmax(Q(s, a)) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this, as time passes, $\\epsilon$ is decreased. So, later when it has learned more, the agent can choose action based on what it has learned than random action.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the second is called an **add random noise**. The concept of this method is that just add random value to each action. \n",
    "\n",
    "![junk_food_random_value](images/junk_food_random_value.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{a} = {\\operatorname{argmax}}{Q(s, a) + {RandomValue}}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "{a} = {\\operatorname{argmax}}{([0.3, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7] + [0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5])}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will choose McDonald's. And also we can use decaying policy with add random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    a = argmax(Q(s, a) + random_value / (i+1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing **$\\epsilon$-greedy policy** and **add random noise**, when the agent choose random action in $\\epsilon$-greedy policy, it is totally random. But same case in add random noise, since the noise_values  are added to the existing $Q(s, a)$ values, it is affected by Q-learning function value even though the agent will choose random action. So, the probability that an action has a high Q-leaning value is selected is higher than $\\epsilon$-greedy policy. Let's check our first algorithm again:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each $s$, $a$ initialize table entry $\\hat{Q}(s, a) \\leftarrow 0$. \n",
    "* Observe current state $s$\n",
    "* Do forever:\n",
    "    * **Select an action $a$ and execute it**\n",
    "    * Receive immediate reward $r$\n",
    "    * Observe the new state $s'$\n",
    "    * Update the table entry for $\\hat{Q}(s, a)$ as follows:        \n",
    "        $\\hat{Q}(s, a) \\leftarrow r + \\max\\hat{Q}(s', a')$\n",
    "    * $s \\leftarrow s'$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, we didn't tell how to select an action and execute it. Now, the agent will select an action with **$\\epsilon$-greedy policy** or **add random noise**. Now, let's implement the Q-learning with add random noise."
